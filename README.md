# Hi, I am Luiz EugÃªnio! ðŸ‘‹

As a confident and highly skilled .NET software engineer with nearly a decade of hands-on experience, I excel in crafting robust, scalable, high-performance applications using cloud-native technologies. My expertise includes the full range of modern tools, from .NET Core 3.1, 7, and 8 to C#, REST APIs, PostgreSQL, and MsSQL, enabling me to deliver powerful and efficient solutions.

In recent projects, Iâ€™ve been at the forefront of integrating advanced technologies such as RabbitMQ, Redis, Kubernetes, and Docker, seamlessly applying event-driven architecture to build state-of-the-art microservices. To ensure high reliability and optimal performance, I utilize Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring and DataDog for comprehensive system monitoring and alerting.

I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code, following SOLID and Clean Code principles, with rigorous unit and integration testing to guarantee quality. My collaborative approach in Agile environments ensures efficient project delivery from concept to production. 

I thrive in fast-paced, innovative settings. I constantly stay ahead of industry trends and leverage the latest in .NET and cloud technologies to drive impactful results.
