# Hi, I am Luiz EugÃªnio! ðŸ‘‹

With eight years of software engineering experience, my professional journey has been characterized by continuous learning and evolution. I began by working with antiquated technologies such as VB.NET, WebForms, and ADO.NET, establishing a solid and profound foundation of knowledge.

This knowledge base of old technologies has provided me with a comprehensive and detailed view of project lifecycles, contributing to my ability to anticipate challenges and deliver robust solutions.

Over the past four years, I have focused on innovative projects, transitioning to cutting-edge technologies such as .NET Core, Microservices, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and event-driven and domain-driven architectures. I also highlight my unit and integration testing proficiency, primarily using xUnit.

In summary, my professional journey reflects a constant pursuit of excellence and an inherent adaptability to the demands of the technology world. I am ready to face complex challenges, contribute to innovative projects, and add value through my diversified experience and deep understanding of software development. If there is a need for someone to lead or contribute to challenging projects, I am available to share my diverse experience and a profound understanding of software development. I am committed to adding value to dynamic teams and collaborating for the ongoing success of innovative projects.
